# JDA-Bot2
BOT

This is a JDA (Java Discord API) Discord Bot in Java (who would have thought), thre are multible (maybe useful) commands and stuff... 
At every point where you see a "//=" at the end of the line you should change whatever is after the "//=" (example "//=BotRole")


Please dont cancel me because of the bad words (in Util.java/badWords) its just a feature to make the Bot (when /say is used) not say those words.
